The original input was: 3 (0 1 5 1) (0 1 5 1) (0 1 10 1) 
The sorted input was:   3 (0 1 5 1) (0 1 5 1) (0 1 10 1) 
The Scheduling Algorithm used was Round Robin

Process 0:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,5,1)
	Finishing Time: 13
	Turnaround Time: 13
	I/O Time: 4
	Waiting Time: 4


Process 1:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,5,1)
	Finishing Time: 14
	Turnaround Time: 14
	I/O Time: 4
	Waiting Time: 5


Process 2:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,10,1)
