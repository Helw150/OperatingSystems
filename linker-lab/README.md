# Make instructions

The code for this linker lab is written in c++ using the c++11 std namespace. 
Building has been tested on crackle1 using `g++ -std=c++11 linker.cpp`

# Use instructions

The code takes the target file name as a command line argument: `./a.out YOUR_FILENAME_HERE`

The code can be run across all test cases given to us using: `bash run_tests.sh`
